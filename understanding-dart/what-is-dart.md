# What is Dart?

According to the [official Dart website](https://dart.dev), "Dart is a client-optimized language for fast apps on any platform." What exactly does that mean? Let's break it down.

## Programming language

First off, what even is a programming language? A human language allows humans to communicate with one anotherâ€”a programming language allows a human, or a _programmer_, to communicate with a computer. **A programming language allows a human to** _**program**_ **a computer what to do.** Dart is one of many thousands of programming languages like Java, Python, C, C\#, C++, Javascript, and Swift.

## Client-optimized

Typically, a programming language runs on either the _front-end_, what the user sees, or the _back-end_, how the app communicates with servers and databases. The front-end is called the _client_, and when Dart is described as being "client-optimized" it means that it was designed specifically to run on front-end clients. These "clients" can be anything from websites to computer applications to phone apps.

It should be noted that Dart is not restricted to the front-end and can be used on the back-end \(server-side\). However, this was not how Dart was designed be to used, and the main focus of its development at Google is to be great on the client-side.

## Fast apps on any platform

You might have heard of the programming language Java which can be used to develop Android applications, or Swift which can be used to develop macOS or iOS apps. Dart with Flutter can be used to develop applications on any platform that supports it; currently, those platforms include macOS, iOS, Android, web, and Linux \(in beta\).
