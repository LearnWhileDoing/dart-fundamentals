# Setting up DartPad

It is important that you get comfortable writing and testing Dart classes \(and Dart code in general\). Before we start to learn and experiment with classes, we will first setup an in-browser development _environment_, a place you run your code.

[Open up dartpad.dev](https://dartpad.dev). Click the "New Pad" button Now, replace the code in the editor with this code.

```java
class Car {

}

void main() {
    Car myCar = new Car();
}
```

That's it for now! Keep this tab open while you are taking the classes tutorial.
