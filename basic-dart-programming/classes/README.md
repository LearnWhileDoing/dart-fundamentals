# Classes

Dart is an "object oriented program", which means that everything in Dart is based around the concepts of _classes_ and _objects_. To further explain this, we are going to make our own Dart program and create a class.

Because classes are such a fundamental part of Dart and Flutter programs, it is important that you have a good understanding of how classes work and how to use them. For this reason, we have split the different topics of Dart classes up into different lessons.
